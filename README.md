# Boilerplate for writing user-friendly, interactive scripts

This repo can be used as a base to write more user-friendly, interactive system scripts.

Browse all the cool functions in `utils.sh` such as `ask_for_confirmation` and `answer_is_yes`. Rad!

`utils.sh` and beginning of `main.sh` taken directly from [Cătălin Mariș's dotfiles](https://github.com/alrra/dotfiles).
Thanks for the great work!
